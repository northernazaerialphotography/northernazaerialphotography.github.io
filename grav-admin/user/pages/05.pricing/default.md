We don't believe in complicated pricing schemes and hidden fees, we strive to maintain a simple pricing structure with no hidden fees.

Let's keep it simple, for most aerial photography work, the following rates apply:
* $50 per hour for flight
* $25 per hour for editing
* 50Â¢ per mile for any location outside of the city boundaries of Flagstaff.
